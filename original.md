i'm devansh. you can <a href="mailto:hello@devanshpanda.com">contact me here</a>.

at standard intelligence. i'm currently training models to take arbitrary actions on computers, with the goal of aligned agi.

previously, I dropped out of hs in the bay to work full-time as the first employee at the atlas fellowship, running infrastructure and much of admissions in 2022, and starting a small high school for myself and other fellows called atlas academy. around that time I ran both <a href="https://prometheus.science/">, the largest science bowl competition in the world, and hackuba, a 20-person, weeklong hackathon in rural japan.

i then spent a bit studying at oxford, where i started the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxfordbreadsoc/">bread society</a> and helped run the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxfordswiftsoc/">taylor swift society.</a> 


in my free time, i quite enjoy cooking, especially for large groups; baking, especially bread; and reading finance blogs ([patrick mackenzie](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/) and [matt levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) stand out amongst the crowd.)
