        <p>hey! i'm devansh. you can <a href="mailto:hello@devanshpanda.com">email me here</a>.</p>

        <p>i work on pretraining models for computer use at <a href="https://si.inc">standard intelligence</a>.</p>

        <p>previously, I dropped out of hs in the bay to work full-time as the first employee at the atlas fellowship, running infrastructure and much of admissions in 2022, and starting a small high school for myself and other fellows called atlas academy. around that time I ran hackuba, a 20-person, weeklong hackathon in rural japan.</p>

        <p>i then spent a bit studying at oxford, where i started the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxfordbreadsoc/">bread society</a> and helped run the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxfordswiftsoc/">taylor swift society</a>.</p>

        <p>in my free time, i quite enjoy cooking for my friends, baking bread, and reading finance blogs (<a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/">patrick mackenzie</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">matt levine</a> are particular favorites.)</p>
