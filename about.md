hey! i'm devansh. you can <a href="mailto:hello@devanshpanda.com">email me here</a>.

i work on pretraining models for computer use at [standard intelligence](https://si.inc).

previously, I dropped out of hs in the bay to work full-time as the first employee at the atlas fellowship, running infrastructure and much of admissions in 2022, and starting a small high school for myself and other fellows called atlas academy. around that time I ran hackuba, a 20-person, weeklong hackathon in rural japan.

i then spent a bit studying at oxford, where i started the [bread society](https://www.instagram.com/oxfordbreadsoc/) and helped run the [taylor swift society](https://www.instagram.com/oxfordswiftsoc/). 


in my free time, i quite enjoy cooking for my friends, baking bread, and reading finance blogs ([patrick mackenzie](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/), [matt levine](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine) are particular favorites.)
